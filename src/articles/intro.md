Thank you for making it this far. My name is David Yarzebinski and I am software engineer that loves to work in React, Node , Kotlin and Go. I like fixing difficult problems and creating beautiful things.

I grew up in Southwest VA and learned what hard work meant starting at a young age. I began programming and playing with computers around the age of 13 and fell in love with figuring out to make it do exactly what I tell it to do and creating things immediately, since then I went to college, got a job developing software and have been getting paid to do the thing I like the most!

Some other hobbies that I have include playing Magic: The Gathering, reading science fiction novels, watching amazing and terrible films (horror is my favorite genre so its very easy to watch both and enjoy them), and cooking dinner with and for my beautiful fiance.

Some various lists about myself.
